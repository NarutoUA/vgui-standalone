# VGUI Standalone app

sample project for creating standalone vgui2 applications
this was mostly pasted together and is only to show the basic outline of how stuff gets done

includes a sample .res for the frame and a sample scheme. Also includes the `CConsoleDialog` window with a few sample concommands aswell.

# make sure to do `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning the original project to get the ssdk files aswell
